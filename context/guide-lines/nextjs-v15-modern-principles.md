# ✅ Modernized Development Principles (Aligned with Next.js v15)

## 1. **Clarity and Simplicity**
- Design components to be small and purpose-driven
- Prefer clear and readable code over cleverness
- Eliminate unnecessary abstractions—build only what’s needed

## 2. **Consistency and Convention**
- Follow a consistent project structure (especially with `app/` routing)
- Align with community conventions (e.g., file-based routing, co-located styles)
- Use consistent naming patterns and code formatting

## 3. **Type Safety**
- Enforce strict TypeScript usage across all layers
- Prefer typed server actions and typed route handlers
- Validate external data with runtime schemas (e.g., Zod)

## 4. **Component First, Not Client First**
- Default to **Server Components**; only use `use client` when interactivity is needed
- Design components as reusable, accessible
- Build UI from `HeroUI` and `radix-ui` unless custom is required

## 5. **Data Coherence**
- Centralize data fetching logic (React Query or Server Actions)
- Ensure UI is a direct reflection of state—no hidden side effects
- Embrace caching strategies (ISR, revalidation, SWR)

## 6. **Error Resilience**
- Design for graceful degradation, not just ideal paths
- Use scoped error boundaries (`error.tsx`) per route
- Provide helpful logs and feedback without overwhelming users

## 7. **Security by Default**
- Sanitize inputs/outputs across the stack
- Secure routes using Middleware and session guards
- Treat all client-side input as untrusted

## 8. **Performance Awareness**
- Be deliberate with `use client` and reactivity
- Use streaming and partial rendering to improve perceived load
- Default to lazy loading, and edge optimizations

## 9. **Developer Experience**
- Keep setup frictionless: clear README, scripts, env templates
- Use linters, formatters, and CI to enforce standards
- Document complex logic and architectural decisions inline

## 10. **Test Like a User**
- Prioritize integration and E2E tests over unit tests
- Validate real-user flows (e.g., forms, auth, data fetching)
- Automate regression checks through CI/CD
